Integration test for CloudBioLinux.

Try:

./test_vagrant --help

== Testing issues ==

The test system depends on a stack of tools, including virtualbox,
vagrant, ssh, ruby and related libraries. Things can go wrong. Here we
list a number of common problems.

=== Error with ssh config ===

The test system appends login code to enter a running vagrant
virtualbox without asking for a password. Sometimes the contents of
$HOME/.ssh/config get corrupted.  Check the contents out, and remove
all wrong information with

  vi ~/.ssh/config

and rerun the test.
