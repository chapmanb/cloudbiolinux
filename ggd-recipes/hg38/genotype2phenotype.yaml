# G2P is a publicly-accessible online system designed to facilitate the development, validation,
# curation and distribution of large-scale, evidence-based datasets for use in diagnostic variant filtering.
# Each G2P entry associates an allelic requirement and a mutational consequence at a defined locus with a disease entity.
# A confidence level and evidence link are assigned to each entry.
