BioNode is an open source software initiative to provide a scalable
Linux virtual machine image for bioinformatics, based on Debian Linux
and Bio Med packages. The image can be deployed on the desktop, using
VirtualBox, on a number of networked PCs, and in the cloud (currently
Amazon EC2 is supported; and OpenStack is planned for).

BioNode is a purely Debian based specialization. BioNode updates and
uses recent bioinformatics software. FOSS BioNode packages should find
their way into main stream Debian packages (blessed by the Bio Med
project). These should be available to all Debian derived
distributions, including Ubuntu and Mint. It may take time, however,
to trickle all the way down.

BioNode shares the architecture of CloudBioLinux for bootstrapping and
installing packages. BioNode BioLinux relevant information is found in
this directory. BioNode specific configurations are hosted in a
separate git repository.

To build a BioNode from scratch, create a fabricrc, and use something like

  fab -H vagrant -f $source/fabfile.py install_biolinux -c $source/contrib/bionode/fabricrc_bionode.txt
