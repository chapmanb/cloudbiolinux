= Private Cloud and CloudBioLinux

CloudBioLinux can be used to create a private Cloud for
Bioinformatics. Essentially, all you need is ssh access to a VM
running somewhere. This VM should be a clean install of Linux.  With
CloudBioLinux Debian and Ubuntu distributions are supported best.

== Start a VM

Start a VM and make sure there is a network defined, and ssh running.
On the VM

       dhclient -v
       ifconfig
       ps xa|grep ssh
       ssh localhost

Check the network (e.g. with Debian)

       apt-get update
       apt-get install vim

You should be able to use the IP address to login from your desktop

       ssh user@VM_IP_address

== Get password free ssh access

The CloudBioLinux fabric tools work best when you have password free
login. If you can login to the remote with

       ssh user@VM_IP_address

you are set. Otherwise, create a password free ssh key. To achieve
this, see the many Internet resources, e.g.
http://www.mtu.net/~engstrom/ssh-agent.php.

== Install sudo without password

Install the sudo program. Next, edit /etc/sudoers with the 'visudo'
command, and add the line

       user ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/bash

where user is your Fabric username. Alternatively add user to the sudo
group.

Now try:

       sudo bash

and you should be root, without a password.

== Install CloudBioLinux

See the README for installing CloudBioLinux and fabric.

== Run fabric

Now you should be set! To install BioLinux

       fab -f $source/fabfile.py -H user@$VM_IP_address -c $fabricrc install_biolinux:packagelist=$packagelist

Where source points to the checked out source tree, e.g.

       export source=$HOME/izip/git/opensource/debian/biolinux

For example, to install the Minimal flavor on Debian stable on a VM
running on IP 192.168.64.105:

       fab -f $source/fabfile.py -H user@192.168.64.105 \
       -c $source/contrib/minimal/fabricrc_debian.txt \
       install_biolinux:packagelist=$source/contrib/minimal/main.yaml

CloudBioLinux shows the following output. First it sets up the
environment

Finally some clean ups

        cloudbiolinux INFO: Target=unknown; Edition=Minimal Edition; Flavor=Base Flavor - no overrides

        [192.168.64.105] sudo: rm -f /var/crash/*

And it is done. Minimal has no post-installation configuration, but
that is easy to add.
