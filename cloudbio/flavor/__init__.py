"""A Flavor reflects a specialization of a base install, the default being BioLinux.

If you want to create a new specialization (say for your own server), the
recommended procedure is to choose an existing base install (Edition) and write
a Flavor. When your Flavor is of interest to other users, it may be a good idea
to commit it to the main project (in ./contrib/flavor).

Other (main) flavors can be found in this directory and in ./contrib/flavors
