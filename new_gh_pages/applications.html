        <p>CloudBioLinux raises the possibly of several applications to advance
          Bioinformatics, many of which are already in development and
          production:</p>

		</span></span></p>
        <p>Written by Enis Afgan and the Galaxy Team, CloudMan is a manager that
          uses CloudBioLinux as a platform to build a full SGE cluster
          environment for hosting the Galaxy application. CloudMan also enables
          Galaxy to run effectively by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Coordinating the cloud infrastructure needed by Galaxy.</li>
          <li>Providing a framework for enabling applications to run on the
            cloud and utilize the infrastructure's elasticity.</li>
          <li>Providing a ready-to-run. dynamically scalable version of Galaxy
            on Amazon AWS.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Backed up by cloud environment provided by CloudMan, Galaxy can
          utilize greater resources than the the traditional configuration of an
          in-house installation. In addition, the scalability offered by cloud
          computing via CloudMan spares users the concern of computing details
          (i.e. number of nodes, etc), as CloudMan can optimize use of resources
          to the workload in question. Many users and organizations may prefer
          the cost of renting space and computational power to use the CloudMan-backed
          Galaxy instance of a 3rd party over the costs of installing, and maintaining,
          their own in-house instance.</p>
        <p>The measure of CloudMan's benefits only increases when considering
          Galaxy's own features of enabling users to add their own custom tools
          and enabling the users of a common Galaxy deployment to share their data,
          tools, pipelines, and workflows with one another.</p>
        <p>Various pipelines have already been developed for Galaxy in
          conjunction with CloudMan:</p>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://172.17.31.104" target="_blank">Viral Assembly and Annotation</a></span></li>
            <ul><li>This set of tools allows a user to assemble and/or annotate 454
              sequence data (along with optional Sanger and Solexa) from any one
              of several viral organisms. The annotation is displayed in an
              extensive, graphical interface through which the user can easily
              acquire more information.</li></ul>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prokaryote Assembly</span></li>
            <ul><li>The JCVI prokaryotic genome annotation pipeline runs a
              collection of scripts and programs allowing the identification of
              genes as well as structural and functional annotation of those
              genes. A variety of 3rd-party tools is run alongside novel scripts
              that collect and analyze results.</li></ul>

		  </span></li>
            <ul><li>A fully automated pipeline for processing high throughput exome
              sequencing data. Using several 3rd-party tools, the pipeline
              performs alignment, realignment, variant detection, and analysis
              summary on input data.</li></ul>
        </ul>

		</span></span></p>
        <p>An extension of CloudBioLinux, in response to feedback from the
          CloudBioLinux community, CloudBioCentral is a web service that
          launches CloudBioLinux and CloudMan clusters on Amazon Web Services
          hardware. This removes all of the manual steps involved in setting up
          security groups and launching a CloudBioLinux instance. A user only
          needs to sign up for an AWS account; BioCloudCentral takes care of
          everything else. The CloudBioCentral web interface itself can be found
          <a href="https://biocloudcentral.herokuapp.com/launch" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
